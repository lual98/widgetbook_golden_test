Automatically generate Flutter golden tests from Widgetbook use cases generated by the [widgetbook_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_generator).

## Overview
This library automates the creation of golden tests for Flutter widgets using Widgetbook use cases generated in the directories file. These files are created using the `widgetbook_generator` package by running `dart run build_runner build -d`. The `runWidgetbookGoldenTests` function traverses these use cases to generate golden files for visual regression testing.

> **Note:** This has been mainly tested with auto-generated directories. Manually editing or creating `*.directories.g.dart` should work as well but is not intended.

## Usage
Import the corresponding directories file generated by `widgetbook_generator`. Then call `runWidgetbookGoldenTests` inside a main of a test file.

```dart
import '../widgetbook/main.directories.g.dart';

void main() {
  runWidgetbookGoldenTests(
    nodes: directories,
    properties: WidgetbookGoldenTestsProperties(),
  );
}

```


## Features
- **Automatic Golden Test Generation:** All Widgetbook use cases are discovered and tested.
- **Network Image Mocking:** Handles network images for reliable golden tests. You can simulate a network image loading errors and loading state by using specific values as the image URLs. These are constants declared in `WidgetbookGoldenTestsProperties` as `WidgetbookGoldenTestsProperties.defaultErrorImageUrl` and `WidgetbookGoldenTestsProperties.defaultLoadingImageUrl` respectively by default. These will trigger the errorBuilder in your `Image.network` widget, or an indefinite loadingBuilder.
- **Easy Integration:** Simply add your Widgetbook use cases and run the tests. Knob values are supported as well.
- **Skippable Cases:** To skip a golden test for a specific use case, add `WidgetbookGoldenTestsProperties.defaultSkipTag` to its name.
- **Custom Properties:** Customize properties with a custom `WidgetbookGoldenTestsProperties` (see more below).
- **Play functions:** Use [WidgetbookGoldenTestBuilder](lib/src/widgetbook_golden_test_builder.dart) at the top level of your use case to provide a list of `goldenActions`. A golden snapshot will be taken after each goldenAction. This allows you to capture snapshots after certain user interactions like scrolling or tapping a button menu.
- **Apply Widgetbook Addons:** Use the Widgetbook Addons to further customize your generated snapshots. **Note:** The order in which addons are declared affects the result.

## How It Works
- Widgetbook use cases are defined and auto-generated in the directories file.
- The directories file is generated using the `widgetbook_generator` package:
```bash
dart run build_runner build -d
```
- The `runWidgetbookGoldenTests` function traverses all use cases and generates golden files for each use case.
- Network images are mocked, based on `mocktail_image_network`'s implementation to ensure consistent results.
- Widgetbook state is mocked so knobs work properly even if they are being used.

## Customization
Use the properties in `WidgetbookGoldenTestsProperties` to customize the properties used in the test execution.
- Modify `skipTag` to change the default tag used to skip golden test execution.
- You can pass your app's theme to `WidgetbookGoldenTestsProperties` to make sure the cases are run with proper theming.
- Use the `addons` property to apply Widgetbook Addons. With these addons, you can change the text scale, add grid guidelines, and more.
- Use a `onTestError` to handle modify the default behavior when a test fails. This can be used to ignore certain errors or add additional functionality like logging.
- You can setup a default locale inside the properties.
- The special URLs for error and loading network images can be changed to custom ones if necessary.
> **Note:** If you want to call `runWidgetbookGoldenTests` twice with different special URLs in each call, do it on separate main functions. The HttpOverrides may conflict on each other and cause hang-ups if they are ran in the same main function. If they share the same URLs, then they can be called in the same main function without issues.
